      <h1>Friday. 5 PM.</h1>
      <p>You are leaving work in McDonough and trying to return home. You rely solely on the MARTA system to get to work from your home in Little Five Points. Luck would have it that it is pouring down rain today, so you try to avoid walking as much as possible. </p>
      <p id="thepoint">It takes 85 minutes for you to get home. 28 of those minutes are spent walking to the nearest MARTA bus stop.</p>
      <p>
       There are as many as 352, 000 people who have to rely on MARTA every weekday, making them "transit-captive". Since MARTA does not equally service areas throughout the Perimeter, there are areas that transit-captive people cannot reach in a timely manner. This is the idea behind wherecantigo.
      </p>
      <p>
        wherecantigo focuses on showing the areas within the Perimeter that MARTA services the least. Each point's color on the map shows the duration that it takes someone to get from that point to Little Five Points using MARTA. The duration reflects our story above, so the duration calculation looks for routes at 5pm on a weekday with the least amount of walking.
